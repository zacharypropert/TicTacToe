/**
 * The heart of a basic tic-tac-toe game.
 * Almost all of the game mechanics are in this class.
 * 
 * v0.01 Just started the project to code a tic-tac-toe game.
 * v0.4 Game is currently working and notifies when someone has won.
 * v0.5 Game mechanics finished, made it so a player can not choose a spot that is already taken.
 * v1 A lot of functionality has been changed
 * 		- changed the way the game board is displayed
 * 		- simplified the method where it checks if there is a winner with loops
 * 		- Added a play again feature
 * 		- the player now chooses their desire location by clicking on the spot
